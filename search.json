    "text": "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CDT Monday, Sep 18, 2023\nSharing knowledge through writing is a critical aspect of scientific activity, including data science. It allows researchers to communicate their findings and insights to a wider audience, build upon existing work, and collaborate with others in their field. However, until recently, there have been limited options for publishing long-form writing and expository analyses authored in Jupyter Notebooks, a popular medium for data scientists.\nEnter Quarto - an innovative, open-source scientific and technical publishing system compatible with Jupyter Notebooks and other popular mediums. Quarto provides data scientists with a seamless way to publish their work in a high-quality format that is easily accessible and shareable. With Quarto, researchers can turn their Jupyter Notebooks into professional-looking publications in a variety of formats, including web pages, books, and slides.\nIn this workshop, we will demonstrate how Quarto enables data scientists to turn their work products into professional, high-quality websites, blog posts, and other shareable artifacts. As a bonus, we will also discuss how you can create and document Python packages using Jupyter Notebooks and Quarto with the help of nbdev."
