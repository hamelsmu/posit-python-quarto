## Resources

The best way to learn is by example.  Here are the best examples:

- [ ] [The Official website](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) 
        - Click "Edit this page" to see the source.
- [ ] [The Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)


:::{.callout-tip}

If  no "Edit this page" button, you can [search](https://github.com/search) a user's GitHub like this:


`owner:username path:_quarto.yml`

[Example](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3Ahamelsmu+path%3A_quarto.yml&type=code)

## It's ok to copy!

Prior to this talk, I had had never made slides in Quarto, let alone embed them in a website.  I followed [Andrew Bray's tutorial](https://andrew.quarto.pub/ohio-asa/) by modifying [his code](https://github.com/asa-quarto/website).
